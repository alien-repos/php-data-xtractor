 Friday 4 November 2016
[2:45:35 PM] Kunal Mangaraj: @isaac, @manju was saying u recommended against repository pattern in JS
[2:45:45 PM] Kunal Mangaraj: any particular reasoning?
[2:46:01 PM] Isaac Raja: Manju who?
[2:46:15 PM] Kunal Mangaraj: wine one
[2:46:20 PM] Mahesh PS: :p
[2:46:25 PM] Mahesh PS: wine one
[2:46:49 PM] Isaac Raja: yeah, that concept is foreign to node.js
[2:47:04 PM] Manjunath A: (cool)
[2:47:11 PM] Kunal Mangaraj: as in?
[2:48:17 PM] Isaac Raja: http://jarrettmeyer.com/2016/02/25/down-with-the-bloody-repository
[2:48:24 PM] Kunal Mangaraj: so what pattern to follow?? directly in models write code??
[2:48:33 PM] Isaac Raja: yeah
[2:48:43 PM] Kunal Mangaraj: what abt cross model codes??
[2:53:32 PM] Isaac Raja: what's the db used?
[2:53:49 PM] Kunal Mangaraj: mysql for now.. but i want to port over to postgres
[2:54:21 PM] Kunal Mangaraj: but since we are using an orm.. codewise it shouldnt matter right?
[2:54:53 PM] Isaac Raja: yeah, it shouldn't
[2:55:00 PM] Isaac Raja: what orm?
[2:55:06 PM] Kunal Mangaraj: bookshelfjs
[2:55:25 PM] Kunal Mangaraj: so back to my original question.. where should i write my cross model logics??
[2:55:39 PM] Kunal Mangaraj: or logics that require multiple models
[2:55:46 PM] Isaac Raja: in a model that makes more sense
[2:56:00 PM] Isaac Raja: user -> usertype
[2:56:05 PM] Isaac Raja: write in user model
[2:56:24 PM] Kunal Mangaraj: but calling one model in another model thats not related isnt that antipattern??
[2:56:47 PM] Isaac Raja: premature abstraction is also an antipattern
[2:56:53 PM] Kunal Mangaraj: hmm
[2:57:15 PM] Isaac Raja: also it depends on how big your application is
[2:57:30 PM] Kunal Mangaraj: so till what level of deep relations is it accepted??
[2:57:37 PM] Kunal Mangaraj: 2 levels down?? 3 levels?
[2:58:21 PM] Isaac Raja: you won't go beyond 3 levels of relations
[2:58:50 PM] Kunal Mangaraj: in our ET projects, there are one relation thats close to 9 levels down..
[2:59:07 PM] Kunal Mangaraj: in that case we heavily rely on repositories to get that data
[2:59:19 PM] Kunal Mangaraj: if the same case is in Node, what to do?
[3:00:03 PM] Isaac Raja: repositories are a right thing to do in that case
[3:00:07 PM] Isaac Raja: 9 levels down?
[3:00:14 PM] Isaac Raja: what is it smoking?
[3:00:15 PM] Kunal Mangaraj: hehe yeah.. awesome db arch
[3:00:16 PM] Kunal Mangaraj: :D
[3:00:21 PM] Kunal Mangaraj: Shree
[3:01:01 PM] Isaac Raja: I would write plain SQL in that case instead of using ORM in that case
[3:01:10 PM] Kunal Mangaraj: true..
[3:01:26 PM] Manjunath A: (y)
[3:01:42 PM] Manjunath A: best is raw sql when there is show much relation
[3:01:44 PM] Kunal Mangaraj: after using eloquent for so long, ive found writing sql directly is much better and faster
[3:02:14 PM] Isaac Raja: eloquent loads all the relationships in memory before executing any SQL
[3:02:20 PM] Kunal Mangaraj: yup
[3:02:36 PM] Isaac Raja: which is insane if you have 1000 rows min
[3:02:49 PM] Kunal Mangaraj: yup.. i actually found a nice way..
[3:03:00 PM] Isaac Raja: withEager helps a little though
[3:03:05 PM] Kunal Mangaraj: use query builder to retrieve ur data in array format
[3:03:31 PM] Kunal Mangaraj: then use model hydrate to convert it back into model object, which gives u back the full power of eloquent
[3:03:45 PM] Mahesh PS: :p
[3:03:46 PM] Kunal Mangaraj: love hydrate and hydrateRaw functionality
[3:03:50 PM] Mahesh PS: hydrate
[3:03:53 PM] Isaac Raja: oh, I didn't know you can convert back to a model object
[3:03:59 PM] Kunal Mangaraj: yup
[3:04:01 PM] Isaac Raja: thanks for the tip
[3:04:05 PM] Kunal Mangaraj: :D
[3:04:08 PM] Mahesh PS: ya I tot him how to do it
[3:04:14 PM] Mahesh PS: :p

 Tuesday 27 December 2016
[8:11:03 PM] Pradeep Thoma: Media received. To view it, go to: https://login.skype.com/login/sso?go=xmmfallback?pic=0-ea-d3-040ad73c8c788d84271dff49a97e7750
[8:11:17 PM] Pradeep Thoma: Learning of the day :)
[8:13:40 PM] Kunal Mangaraj: (rofl)
[8:15:04 PM] Pradeep Thoma: Habits dont change
[8:15:11 PM] Kunal Mangaraj: true
[8:16:30 PM] Pradeep Thoma: But it didn’t fail and went to ‘else’…how come?
[8:17:00 PM] Kunal Mangaraj: JS accepts both elseif and else if i think
[8:17:49 PM] Pradeep Thoma: No. This was a PHP code which I wrote
[8:18:33 PM] Engit Prabhat: :D
[8:18:57 PM] Kunal Mangaraj: :D
[8:19:25 PM] Kunal Mangaraj: i think in PHP writing else if (with space) directly goes to the last else statement...
[8:19:28 PM] * Kunal Mangaraj goes to test
[8:20:52 PM] Pradeep Thoma: but that is an syntax error
[8:21:38 PM] Kunal Mangaraj: yeah PHP is equally weird as JS is
[8:21:40 PM] Kunal Mangaraj: :D
[8:24:00 PM] Kunal Mangaraj: In PHP, you can also write 'else if' (in two words) and the behavior would be identical to the one of 'elseif' (in a single word).
[8:24:05 PM] Kunal Mangaraj: for PHP manual
[8:24:19 PM] Kunal Mangaraj: yup its officially worse than JS
[8:24:48 PM] Pradeep Thoma: may be the version we are using is too old…I will check with Suresh
[8:25:01 PM] Kunal Mangaraj: hmm
[8:30:19 PM] Pradeep Thoma: I’m waiting for professors answer on this
[8:30:42 PM] Kunal Mangaraj: i think he went home
[8:30:48 PM] Pradeep Thoma: :)
[8:32:23 PM] Pradeep Thoma: I want a programming language like this
[8:32:25 PM] Pradeep Thoma: https://studio.code.org/s/mc/stage/1/puzzle/1
[8:33:27 PM] Pradeep Thoma: This prevents people from coding after drunk…because they will not know which is left and and which is right
[8:36:31 PM] Kunal Mangaraj: nice

[5:54:10 PM] Isaac Raja: Asshole Driven development (ADD) – Any team where the biggest jerk makes all the big decisions is asshole driven development. All wisdom, logic or process goes out the window when Mr. Asshole is in the room, doing whatever idiotic, selfish thing he thinks is best. There may rules and processes, but Mr. A breaks them and people follow anyway.

JavaScript classes introduced in ECMAScript 2015 are syntactical sugar over JavaScript's existing prototype-based inheritance. The class syntax is not introducing a new object-oriented inheritance model to JavaScript. JavaScript classes provide a much simpler and clearer syntax to create objects and deal with inheritance.

[4:27:23 PM] Isaac Raja: |-)
[4:27:32 PM] Kunal Mangaraj: sir @professor is coming for party.. we will fix all then and there itself
[4:27:43 PM] jitn jtn: :O
[4:28:15 PM] Pradeep Thoma: I have following PHP code…basically a regex test array to call different function depending on URL match
[4:28:18 PM] Pradeep Thoma: array('regex' => "/^\\/contentConverters\\//", 'fn' => 'conversionKickoff'),
    array('regex' => "/^\\/contentConverters\\/([^\\/]+)/", 'fn' => 'getConversionStatus'),
[4:28:44 PM] Pradeep Thoma: $requestUrl = explode('pcc.php', $_SERVER['REQUEST_URI']);
$pathInfo = explode('?', $requestUrl[1]);
foreach ($urls as $url) {
    $matches = array();
    if (preg_match($url['regex'], $pathInfo[0], $matches)) {
        $x = $url['fn'];
        $x($matches);
    }
}
[4:29:13 PM] Pradeep Thoma: When URL is like this it works fine - https://app.zuppudy.com/backend/prizm/viewer-webtier/pcc.php/contentConverters/
[4:29:35 PM] Pradeep Thoma: when it is like this => https://app.zuppudy.com/backend/prizm/viewer-webtier/pcc.php/contentConverters/lZ8ZgzviCp0Jz_jDC6sRZA
[4:30:02 PM] Pradeep Thoma: Instead of going to ‘getConversionStatus’ it still goes to ‘conversionKickoff’
[4:30:10 PM] Pradeep Thoma: But it was working fine earlier
[4:31:00 PM] Kunal Mangaraj: did format of url change??
[4:31:19 PM] Pradeep Thoma: No
[4:32:01 PM] Engit Prabhat: regex logic?
[4:32:07 PM] Pradeep Thoma: yes
[4:32:10 PM] Engit Prabhat: it doesn't look right
[4:32:44 PM] Engit Prabhat: sir whats the logic it matches

\/contentConverters\/
[4:33:10 PM] Pradeep Thoma: Yes. Right now it is matching first one
[4:33:34 PM] Pradeep Thoma: It will never go to second one…even though the URL pattern is matchin
[4:34:01 PM] Pradeep Thoma: Shud I put the second line on top of first?
[4:35:10 PM] Kunal Mangaraj: nope
[4:35:13 PM] Kunal Mangaraj: it wont solve
[4:35:23 PM] Kunal Mangaraj: right now its actually matching both
[4:35:30 PM] Kunal Mangaraj: gimme some time will fix
[4:35:51 PM] Pradeep Thoma: Super. It was working fine earlier. I Thi
[4:36:20 PM] Pradeep Thoma: I think Suresh did some update…may be PHP version change not sure. Just a hint
[4:38:19 PM] Kunal Mangaraj: sir change the regex to this
[4:38:20 PM] Kunal Mangaraj: array('regex' => "/^\\/contentConverters\\/$/", 'fn' => 'conversionKickoff'),
    array('regex' => "/^\\/contentConverters\\/([^\\/]+)/", 'fn' => 'getConversionStatus'),
[4:38:30 PM] Kunal Mangaraj: the first one has a $ symbol added
[4:38:31 PM] Engit Prabhat: 😎
[4:38:40 PM] Kunal Mangaraj: @engit solved it :P
[4:38:44 PM] Pradeep Thoma: let me try
[4:40:10 PM] Kunal Mangaraj: ok
[4:42:40 PM] Engit Prabhat: but that requires the link to have / in end
[4:42:52 PM] Engit Prabhat: first regex is like exact match
[4:44:25 PM] Pradeep Thoma: Works like a charm (y)
[4:44:32 PM] Pradeep Thoma: Both the cases :)
[4:44:41 PM] Kunal Mangaraj: :D

 Monday 3 April 2017
[5:56:33 PM] Pradeep Thoma: Trailing commas simplify adding and removing items to objects and arrays, since only the lines you are modifying must be touched. Another argument in favor of trailing commas is that it improves the clarity of diffs when an item is added or removed from an object or array:
[5:56:53 PM] Pradeep Thoma: Start doing it if you are not doing it already :)
[5:57:06 PM] Pradeep Thoma: http://eslint.org/docs/rules/comma-dangle
[7:10:03 PM] Isaac Raja: (like)

 Tuesday 30 May 2017
[5:44:56 PM] Engit Prabhat: @isaac

is this curry, ok? i was trying it out.

https://gist.github.com/john-e/da34aa20223d83fb2caa9a062c6802b2
[5:46:47 PM] Engit Prabhat: took me 10 mins :D
[6:06:08 PM] Isaac Raja: oh, recursive version
[6:06:14 PM] Isaac Raja: you don't have to implement it
[6:06:29 PM] Isaac Raja: it's implemented by lot of people
[6:06:30 PM] Engit Prabhat: i was bored
[6:06:36 PM] Isaac Raja: you've to use it :)
[6:06:46 PM] Engit Prabhat: so implemented it
[6:07:04 PM] Isaac Raja: oh, you need something to try?
[6:07:19 PM] Engit Prabhat: review 🤓
[6:08:43 PM] Engit Prabhat: is it, good?
[6:10:30 PM] Engit Prabhat: fn.length fails when default value to param is given
[6:11:07 PM] Isaac Raja: oh
[6:11:44 PM] Engit Prabhat: for that i thought of regex approach 
but that an overkill
[6:11:55 PM] Isaac Raja: can you implement curryRight using this curry function
[6:12:07 PM] Engit Prabhat: curryRight?
[6:12:26 PM] Isaac Raja: instead of applying arguments from the left
[6:12:32 PM] Isaac Raja: apply it from the right
[6:12:45 PM] Engit Prabhat: e.g
[6:13:28 PM] Engit Prabhat: i think swapping args2 and args in closure would do it
[6:13:43 PM] Isaac Raja: you have to use the curry function you've created
[6:13:59 PM] Engit Prabhat: what?
[6:14:12 PM] Engit Prabhat: i did some test it works
[6:14:43 PM] Engit Prabhat: in case of (...args) functions it fails
[6:15:10 PM] Engit Prabhat: coz no defined finite set of params
[6:15:49 PM] Isaac Raja: ok
[6:16:03 PM] Isaac Raja: let me check in jsbin
[6:16:15 PM] Engit Prabhat: (like)
[6:17:36 PM] Isaac Raja: jsbin is down :9
[6:21:21 PM] Engit Prabhat: lol
[6:22:11 PM] Engit Prabhat: chrome dev :P
[6:27:46 PM] Isaac Raja: not working
[6:27:47 PM] Isaac Raja: https://codepen.io/pen/?editors=0012
[6:33:28 PM] Engit Prabhat:  i dont see anything
[6:33:32 PM] Engit Prabhat: blank
[6:35:11 PM] Engit Prabhat: save and share link
[6:35:19 PM] Isaac Raja: ok
[6:35:45 PM] Isaac Raja: https://codepen.io/anon/pen/qmzYaW?editors=0012
[6:37:15 PM] Engit Prabhat: lol wrong
[6:37:22 PM] Engit Prabhat: curry(add.....
[6:37:35 PM] Engit Prabhat: you forgot to curry
[6:38:16 PM] Isaac Raja: yeah
[6:38:19 PM] Isaac Raja: sorry
[6:38:30 PM] Engit Prabhat: function and args separate
[6:38:30 PM] Isaac Raja: still not working
[6:38:55 PM] Engit Prabhat: add(3) will call the add function
[6:39:24 PM] Engit Prabhat: it should be 
curry(add, 3)
[6:40:59 PM] Engit Prabhat: https://codepen.io/anon/pen/pPXVeZ?editors=0012
[6:44:30 PM] Engit Prabhat: curryRight 

just replace with 

fn(...(args.reverse()))
[6:44:41 PM] Engit Prabhat: :P
[6:46:12 PM] Isaac Raja: then this is not a curry implementation
[6:46:15 PM] Isaac Raja: proper
[6:46:21 PM] Engit Prabhat: lol
[6:46:27 PM] Isaac Raja: i'll just pass a function
[6:46:34 PM] Isaac Raja: I won't give you the params
[6:46:43 PM] Engit Prabhat: then also it will work
[6:47:09 PM] Engit Prabhat: but in your case you're passing param to function that would invoke add function
[6:47:10 PM] Isaac Raja: https://codepen.io/anon/pen/qmzYaW?editors=0012
[6:47:44 PM] Isaac Raja: it should invoke add function
[6:47:58 PM] Engit Prabhat: curry(add(3))
[6:47:59 PM] Engit Prabhat: this
[6:48:04 PM] Engit Prabhat: i m talking of
[6:48:13 PM] Engit Prabhat: add will be call with param 3
[6:48:26 PM] Isaac Raja: but add function should return me another function  which when called with the next param, should return the result
[6:48:26 PM] Engit Prabhat: that is not curry then
[6:49:18 PM] Isaac Raja: I think you didn't understand curry
[6:49:23 PM] Isaac Raja: :)
[6:49:23 PM] Engit Prabhat: lol
[6:49:57 PM] Isaac Raja: curried add(3) should give me a function
[6:50:03 PM] Engit Prabhat: line 12 should be 
either curry(add,3)
or
curry(add)(3)
[6:50:22 PM] Isaac Raja: which i can call later with the remaining args
[6:50:52 PM] Engit Prabhat: that means you need to pass function from add function
[6:51:05 PM] Engit Prabhat: lol i am not confused
[6:51:31 PM] Engit Prabhat: add(3) will invoke your add funtion with returning Nan
[6:51:38 PM] Engit Prabhat: 3 + undefined
[6:52:36 PM] Isaac Raja: then I guess you'r implementation is wroong
[6:53:00 PM] Isaac Raja: https://wiki.haskell.org/Currying
[6:53:04 PM] Engit Prabhat: your thinking of add(3) with give out function
[6:53:47 PM] Engit Prabhat: but you functio definition is 

add = functio (a,b) {
return a+b
}
[6:54:02 PM] Engit Prabhat: how will it return func
[6:55:22 PM] Isaac Raja: whatever may be my function defintion, when i call curry(myfunc), it should curry it
[6:55:31 PM] Engit Prabhat: sir, leave ET :P
[6:55:48 PM] Isaac Raja: that means, it should make it accept one argument
[6:55:53 PM] Engit Prabhat: but you're calling curry(func(param))
[6:56:04 PM] Isaac Raja: yeah, it'll be save in a closure
[6:56:11 PM] Isaac Raja: the param
[6:56:18 PM] Isaac Raja: *saved
[6:56:49 PM] Engit Prabhat: but add(3) gets called and return is then passed to curry func
[6:57:13 PM] Engit Prabhat: as you wrote

curry( add(3) )
[7:01:33 PM] Isaac Raja: ok,  then tell me how should I use?
[7:02:15 PM] Engit Prabhat: :(
[7:02:42 PM] Engit Prabhat: curry(add)(3) or curry(add, 3)
[7:04:09 PM] Engit Prabhat: see lodash curry example also
[7:04:40 PM] Engit Prabhat: first param is just function and functions are passed as seperate params
[7:18:04 PM] Isaac Raja: yeah
[7:18:16 PM] Isaac Raja: I send the params
[7:19:25 PM] Isaac Raja: while currying
[7:19:34 PM] Isaac Raja: working
[7:20:59 PM] Isaac Raja: my mistake
[7:21:00 PM] Isaac Raja: https://codepen.io/anon/pen/pPXVeZ?editors=0012
[7:21:30 PM] Isaac Raja: but curry(add, 3) is convenient but not in haskell
[7:24:48 PM] Isaac Raja: cool
[7:25:27 PM] Isaac Raja: curry right you've to implement with curry
 Wednesday 31 May 2017
[2:40:23 PM] Engit Prabhat: dont know abt haskell
but js curry(add(3)) wont work
[3:29:03 PM] Isaac Raja: yeah, I told my mistake
[3:29:11 PM] Isaac Raja: I was calling the function
[3:29:48 PM] Isaac Raja: but curry(add, 3) is not necessary curry(add) is enough
[3:55:13 PM] Engit Prabhat: yes
[3:55:29 PM] Engit Prabhat: haskell how it is done?
[3:56:09 PM] Engit Prabhat: not mistake 

ET is frying you.

tired?
[3:57:24 PM] Kunal Mangaraj: lol
[3:59:02 PM] Isaac Raja: all functions are auto curryed in haskell
[3:59:32 PM] Engit Prabhat: huh nice
[4:00:32 PM] Engit Prabhat: in js, Function prototype to do same?
[4:25:29 PM] Isaac Raja: is it ?
[4:26:50 PM] Engit Prabhat: looking into it
[4:26:59 PM] Engit Prabhat: but i dont think possible

YOU are full of bullshit.

C++ is a horrible language. It's made more horrible by the fact that a lot 
of substandard programmers use it, to the point where it's much much 
easier to generate total and utter crap with it. Quite frankly, even if 
the choice of C were to do nothing but keep the C++ programmers out, 
that in itself would be a huge reason to use C.

In other words: the choice of C is the only sane choice. I know Miles 
Bader jokingly said "to piss you off", but it's actually true. I've come 
to the conclusion that any programmer that would prefer the project to be 
in C++ over C is likely a programmer that I really would prefer to piss 
off, so that he doesn't come and screw up any project I'm involved with.

C++ leads to really really bad design choices. You invariably start using 
the "nice" library features of the language like STL and Boost and other 
total and utter crap, that may "help" you program, but causes:

 - infinite amounts of pain when they don't work (and anybody who tells me 
   that STL and especially Boost are stable and portable is just so full 
   of BS that it's not even funny)

 - inefficient abstracted programming models where two years down the road 
   you notice that some abstraction wasn't very efficient, but now all 
   your code depends on all the nice object models around it, and you 
   cannot fix it without rewriting your app.

In other words, the only way to do good, efficient, and system-level and 
portable C++ ends up to limit yourself to all the things that are 
basically available in C. And limiting your project to C means that people 
don't screw that up, and also means that you get a lot of programmers that 
do actually understand low-level issues and don't screw things up with any 
idiotic "object model" crap.

So I'm sorry, but for something l
[4:34:33 PM] Kunal Mangaraj: You and a friend need to share a toy:

You ask a friend if he can play with the toy.

Your friend asks you if you actually asked him for the toy.

Your tell your friend that you asked for that toy.

He gives you the toy.

UDP:

Your friend throws a toy at you and walks away.
[4:34:39 PM] Kunal Mangaraj: how TCP vs UDP works
[4:35:21 PM] Isaac Raja: A UDP packet walks into the bar. A UDP packet walks into the bar. A UDP packet walks into the bar. A UDP packet walks into the bar. A UDP packet walks into the bar.
The bartender says hello.
[4:35:50 PM] Isaac Raja: TCP packet walks into a bar & says “I’d like a beer.” Barman replies “You’d like a beer?” “Yes,” replies TCP packet,“I’d like a beer.”
[4:36:06 PM] Kunal Mangaraj: (rofl)
[4:37:02 PM] Isaac Raja: "Hi, I'd like to hear a TCP joke."
"Hello, would you like to hear a TCP joke?"
"Yes, I'd like to hear a TCP joke."
"Ok, I'll tell you a TCP joke."
"Ok, I will hear a TCP joke."
"Are you ready to hear a TCP joke?"
"Yes, I am ready to hear a TCP joke."
"Ok, I am about to send the TCP joke. It will last 10 seconds, it has two characters, it does not have a setting, it ends with a punchline."
"Ok, I am ready to get your TCP joke that will last 10 seconds, has two characters, does not have an explicit setting, and ends with a punchline."
"I'm sorry, your connection has timed out. Hello, would you like to hear a TCP joke?"
[4:37:14 PM] Isaac Raja: "I would tell you a joke about UDP, but you probably wouldn't get it."
[4:37:58 PM] Kunal Mangaraj: nice explanation

[11:16:51 AM] Pradeep Thoma: Used https://github.com/jaredpalmer/razzle for HMR and you can have single repo for both Server and Client. Good thing is that you can have shared npm modules for both server and client(ie. you will use same underscore.js for both server and client).
[11:18:20 AM] Pradeep Thoma: tl;dr: 2 configs, 2 ports, 2 webpack instances, both watching and hot reloading the same filesystem, in parallel during development and a little webpack.output.publicPath magic.

In development mode (razzle start), Razzle bundles both your client and server code using two different webpack instances running with Hot Module Replacement in parallel. While your server is bundled and run on whatever port your specify in src/index.js (3000 is the default), the client bundle (i.e. entry point at src/client.js) is served via webpack-dev-server on a different port (3001 by default) with its publicPath explicitly set to localhost:3001 (and not / like many other setups do). Then the server's html template just points to the absolute url of the client JS: localhost:3001/static/js/client.js. Since both webpack instances watch the same files, whenever you make edits, they hot reload at exactly the same time. Best of all, because they use the same code, the same webpack loaders, and the same babel transformations, you never run into a React checksum mismatch error.
